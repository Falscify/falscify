## General info
Currently, we as scientists face the problem that only positive research results are published. This leads to unnecessary repetition of experiments and loss of time and resources. **Falscify** comes with a solution! This is an open access database containing negative results of experiments in different fields of science. These results take the form of short, unified reports. Reports are reviewed by the other members of the community. In return rewievers receive points enabling them to get their reports rewieved faster. It is a revolution in the today's science, which will reduce the redundancy of unreported research and will fully reward scientists for their effort put into experiments.

## Usage

**Falscify** is a free web service. You can read all the reports without signing in. Registration is required to publish or review reports.
