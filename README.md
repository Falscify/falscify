## General Info
Currently, we as scientists face the problem that only positive research results are published. This leads to unnecessary repetition of experiments. Falscify comes with a solution! This is an opensource database containing negative results of experiments in different fields of science. These results take the form of short, unified reports. Reports are reviewed by the other members of the community. In return they receive points enabling them to get their reports rewieved faster. It is a revolution in the today's science, which will reduce the redundancy of research and will fully reward scientists for their effort put into experiments.

## Usage

Falscify is a free software. You can read all the reports without signing in. Registration is required to publish or review reports. You have to provide your name, surname, research unit, login and password. The more works reviewed, the more points the reviewer earns. This makes his reports higher in the queue of other reviewers, which means they will be reviewed faster.
