    <!-- Problem statement -->
    <h2>The problem we are trying to solve</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
      The current crisis in science revolves around the issue of <i>publication bias</i>,
      where only positive results are often favored for publication. This creates
      a skewed representation of scientific research and can lead to a distortion
      of knowledge and understanding. By selectively publishing positive results,
      important but statistically insignificant findings or inconclusive studies
      are often overlooked, preventing a comprehensive understanding of a particular
      field. This bias can stem from various factors such as the pressure to publish in
      high-impact journals, the preference of journals for novel or groundbreaking results,
      and the tendency of researchers to prioritize positive outcomes.
    </div>

    <!-- Goal -->
    <h2>Our goal</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <b>Falscify</b> is here to serve the research community by publishing these so-called negative
      results. However, our platform is something much more than a database of reports.
      <b>Falscify</b> is a platform that brings together scientists and allows them to show
      results that couldn't be published. Our main goal is to show the world that the
      negative result is as much important as the positive result. By introducing
      <b>Falscify</b> we want to break the dogma of confirmatory science and enter an era
      of bias mitigation-focused science.
    </div>

    <!-- Mission -->
    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
      As a pioneer of bias mitigation-focused open access publishing,
      <b>Falscify</b> is based on the following values and guiding principles:
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Open Access</li>
        <li>Community</li>
        <li>Simplicity</li>
        <li>High Quality Service</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Team -->
    <h2>Passionate about science</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
      The creators of this platform are two unwavering dreamers who possess a
      profound love for science. They strongly disagree with the current state
      of science and are determined to enact change.
    </div>

    <!-- Name -->
    <h2><b>Why 'falscify'?</b></h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <b>Falscify</b> is derived from the word 'falsify', which means to demonstrate the
      falsehood of a statement or theory. Our aim is to demonstrate that these
      results are equally valid. We aspire to provide scientists with a platform
      where they can freely share such results and leverage the knowledge of others.
